# ERC-721: Non Fungible Tokens

in your smart contract if you need to represent an un-fungible asset which is an asset that cannot be exchanged against another one you need to use this protocol.

Instead of creating your own implementation, is faster and safer to use the implementation of Open Zeppelin

if there is a constructor in the source code, you have to call it in our token.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

// Standard
import '@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol';

// Interface
import '@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/IERC721.sol';

// Extensions
import '@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721Burnable.sol';
import '@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721Metadata.sol';
import '@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721Enumerable.sol';

// Presets
// preconfigured combinations of the above features
import '@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/preset/ERC721PresetMinterPauserAutoId.sol';

// Utils
import '@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/utils/ERC721Holder.sol';

contract MyContract is ERC721,ERC721Enumerable,  ERC721Burnable {
  constructor() public {}

  pause()
  unpause()
}

contract MyOtherContract {
  function foo() external {

    // then you can call any functions that you want
    IERC721(0x.......).transfer()....
  }
}


contract MyERC721Holder is ERC721Holder {}

```

---

## Metadata

one option that you will want almost for sure is the metadata option.
mapping of IPFS URLs to single token ID

---

## Enumerable

numeration extension that allow you to enumerate all the token that a specific address possess.

we can list all the token of a specific address

```solidity
tokenOfOwnerByIdex(address)
```

with these two functions you can list all the token of the of the whole smart contract regardless of the address

```solidity
totalSupply()
tokenByIndex(index)
```

---

## Full

in V3 `ERC721Full.sol` was included in the base contract of ERC721

---

## Burnable

```solidity
burn(tokenId)
```

---

## Mintable

```solidity
mint(to, tokenId)
```

mintWithTokenURI extension

---

## Pausable

basic pause functionalities

---

## interface

interact with an already deployed ERC721 token
also compatibility can be reached with ERC721Holder
